# Laddersnakes
Python scripts to do little algorithmic things.

Curiosities, conveniences, interview prep. (Darn, can't find a way to alliterate.) For fun, for practice.

Might implement a better way to test each of these little algorithms, or test en masse, at some point.
Unfortunately the inputs expected by each can be different enough that there isn't any simple way to generalize it.
